# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the user's request. They want me to summarize AI news articles into markdown format with specific details: date in IST timezone, concise summaries, sorted by latest first, and include the source URLs as links. 

First, I need to process each of the provided articles. There are quite a few, so I'll need to go through each one carefully. Let me list out the key points for each.

For each article, I need to extract the date, which is in GMT. The user wants the IST date. Since IST is GMT+5:30, I'll have to convert each GMT date to IST. Let me check each date and adjust accordingly.

Next, the summary. The user wants concise sentences. I'll need to read through the content of each article and pick out the main AI-related news. Some articles have multiple pieces of information, so I'll focus on the most relevant part.

Sorting them by date, latest first. The most recent articles are from August 6th. Let me check all the dates to ensure proper ordering.

Now, let's start with the first article. The URL is from startupnews.fyi, dated August 1, 2025. The content mentions Ethan Thornton at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 talking about AI in defense. The summary should capture that.

Another article from August 5th mentions the US adding OpenAI, Google, Anthropic to the approved AI vendors. That's a key point. Need to make sure the summary reflects that.

The article from August 6th about Microsoft creating self-defending software is important. Also, the one about the Akira affiliates abusing Windows drivers is a cybersecurity issue related to AI.

I need to check for duplicates. For example, one article from startupnews.fyi is mentioned twice, but the dates and content differ. So they are separate.

Also, some articles have dates in different formats. For example, "Sat, 02 Aug 2025 05:02:40 GMT" needs conversion to IST. Let me verify each date conversion.

After extracting the information, I'll format each entry as per the user's instructions: ### [Date], then the summary with the link. Ensure the links are correctly formatted as markdown links. Also, check that the dates are in IST, so adding 5 hours and 30 minutes to the GMT time.

I need to be careful with the date conversion. For example, if the article is from 05:02:40 GMT on August 2, adding 5h30m makes it 10:32:40 IST. But if the original date is August 1, 17:59:40 GMT, adding 5h30m makes it August 2, 23:29:40 IST. Wait, that's actually moving into the next day. So the IST date might be August 2 instead of August 1 for that article. Wait, let me recheck that.

Original date: Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:59:40 GMT. Adding 5h30m: 17:59:40 + 5h30m = 23:29:40 on the same day. So IST date is still August 1, 2025. Wait, no. Wait, IST is 5h30m ahead. So if the GMT time is 17:59, adding 5h30m would be 23:29 on the same day. So the date remains August 1. But if the GMT time is 23:59, adding 5h30 would be 05:29 next day. So need to check each date.

For example, the article with date Wed, 06 Aug 2025 01:24:57 GMT. Adding 5h30m would be 06:54:57 IST on August 6. So the date remains August 6.

Once the date is correctly converted, format it as YYYY-MM-DD. Then the summary. Let me go through each article again to make sure I didn't miss any important points.

After processing all articles, sort them from latest to oldest. The latest is August 6th, then August 5th, etc.

Let me compile all the entries now, ensuring the correct date conversion, concise summary, and proper sorting.
