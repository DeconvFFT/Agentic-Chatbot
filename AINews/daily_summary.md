# Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, I need to process these AI news articles and summarize them into markdown format as per the given instructions. Let me start by reading through each article and extracting the necessary information.

First, I need to note the date in IST timezone. The dates provided are in GMT, so I need to convert them to IST. Since IST is GMT+5:30, I'll add 5 hours and 30 minutes to each date. Let me check each date:

1. The first article has a date of "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:52:00 GMT". Adding 5h30m gives 22:22, so the IST date is 2025-08-06.

2. The second article is "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 01:24:57 GMT". Adding 5h30m makes it 7:54:57 IST. So same date, 2025-08-06.

3. Third article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:11:37 GMT" becomes 17:41:37 IST, same date.

4. Fourth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:23:03 GMT" converts to 18:53:03 IST.

5. Fifth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:08:38 GMT" becomes 16:38:38 IST.

6. Sixth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:55:42 GMT" is 18:25:42 IST.

7. Seventh article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:18:01 GMT" converts to 20:48:01 IST.

8. Eighth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:32:00 GMT" becomes 02:02:00 IST on 2025-08-07. Wait, the date is 06 Aug 2025, so adding 5h30m would be 01:02:00 IST next day? Wait, 20:32 GMT is 8:32 PM. Adding 5h30m would be 1:02 AM IST next day. But the next day is 07 Aug. So the IST date would be 2025-08-07 for this article.

9. Ninth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 01:01:32 GMT" becomes 6:31:32 IST, same date.

10. Tenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 09:00:02 GMT" is 14:30:02 IST.

11. Eleventh article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 07:28:48 GMT" converts to 12:58:48 IST.

12. Twelfth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:56:48 GMT" becomes 16:26:48 IST.

13. Thirteenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:29:28 GMT" is 19:59:28 IST.

14. Fourteenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:25:59 GMT" becomes 02:55:59 IST on 2025-08-07.

15. Fifteenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:05:38 GMT" converts to 02:35:38 IST on 2025-08-07.

16. Sixteenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 18:18:10 GMT" is 23:48:10 IST.

17. Seventeenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT" becomes 15:30:00 IST.

18. Eighteenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 18:53:06 GMT" converts to 00:23:06 IST next day, so 2025-08-07.

19. Nineteenth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:35:49 GMT" is 19:05:49 IST.

20. Twentieth article: "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:04:21 GMT" becomes 15:34:21 IST.

Wait, I need to check all dates again to ensure accuracy. For example, the eighth article's date in GMT is 20:32 on 06 Aug, converting to IST would be 01:02 AM on 07 Aug. But the user's instruction says to list by date in IST. So the eighth article's date is 2025-08-07. Similarly, the fourteenth and fifteenth articles also have dates converting to 02:55:59 and 02:35:38 IST on 2025-08-07.

Now, I need to sort all articles by IST date, latest first. The latest is 07 Aug 2025, then 06 Aug.

Let me list the IST dates for all articles:

1. 2025-08-07 (8th article)
2. 2025-08-07 (14th article)
3. 2025-08-07 (15th article)
4. 2025-08-07 (18th article)
5. 2025-08-06 (others)

But need to check each date conversion correctly.

Wait, the eighth article's date is 20:32 GMT, which is 20:32 + 5h30m = 02:02 AM IST the next day, which is 2025-08-07. Similarly, the fourteenth article is 20:25:59 GMT → 02:55:59 IST on 07 Aug. The fifteenth article is 20:05:38 GMT → 02:35:38 IST on 07 Aug. The eighteenth article is 18:53:06 GMT → 00:23:06 IST on 07 Aug.

So the articles with 07 Aug IST date are the 8th, 14th, 15th, and 18th. The rest are on 06 Aug.

Now, for each article, I need to create a summary. The summary should be concise, one sentence. Then, the source URL as a link.

I need to make sure not to include any other information, just the summary and URL. Also, sort by date latest first. So first the 07 Aug articles, then 06 Aug.

Let me start with the 07 Aug ones:

1. Eighth article: Google commits $1 billion for AI training at US universities. URL: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/google-commits-us1-billion-for-ai-training-at-us-universities-619376

2. Fourteenth article: Elion raises $9.3M for healthcare AI research and intelligence platform. URL: https://hitconsultant.net/2025/08/06/elion-raises-9-3m-for-healthcare-ai-research-and-intelligence/

3. Fifteenth article: Some questions about that global AI race. URL: https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2025/08/06/some-questions-about-that-global-ai-race-00495921

4. Eighteenth article: Google isn't weakening web traffic, says VP of Google Search. URL: https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407987/google-isnt-weakening-web-traffic-says-vp-of-goo.html

Then the 06 Aug articles:

The rest of the articles. Let me list them in order of IST time from latest to earliest:

- 20:48 IST: MobiHealthNews article on deploying AI tools. URL: https://www.mobihealthnews.com/video/how-successfully-deploy-ai-tools

- 23:48 IST: TechCrunch article on Google's new Guided Learning tool. URL: https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/google-takes-on-chatgpts-study-mode-with-new-guided-learning-tool-in-gemini/

- 22:22 IST: TOI article on Microsoft's AI self-defending software. URL: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-creates-ai-powered-self-defending-software-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/123146780.cms

- 20:25 IST: Elion's article (already listed under 07 Aug)

Wait, the first article (TOI) is from 16:52 GMT → 22:22 IST, so that's the latest on 06 Aug. Then others like the MobiHealthNews article is 15:18 GMT → 20:48 IST. TechCrunch is 18:18 GMT → 23:48 IST. Then others.

So the order for 06 Aug is sorted by IST time descending:

1. TechCrunch article (23:48)
2. MobiHealthNews (20:48)
3. TOI (22:22)
4. Fox News article on Trump admin and OpenAI (13:29 GMT → 19:59 IST)
5. Intuit survey on accountants adopting AI (09:00 GMT → 14:30 IST)
6. Akira affiliates abusing Windows drivers (12:11 GMT → 17:41 IST)
7. TCS layoffs and AI workforce survey (01:24 GMT → 7:54 IST)
... etc.

I need to list all the 06 Aug articles in order of IST time from latest to earliest.

Let me go through each article:

1. TechCrunch: 18:18 GMT → 23:48 IST (date 2025-08-06)
2. MobiHealthNews: 15:18 GMT → 20:48 IST (2025-08-06)
3. TOI: 16:52 GMT → 22:22 IST (2025-08-06)
4. Fox article: 13:29 GMT → 19:59 IST (2025-08-06)
5. Intuit: 09:00 GMT → 14:30 IST
6. CSOOnline (Akira): 12:11 GMT → 17:41 IST
7. Indiatvnews TCS layoffs: 01:24 GMT → 7:54 IST
8. CSOOnline (SpyCloud): 12:55 GMT → 18:25 IST
9. Ynet article on AI bot: 07:28 GMT → 12:58 IST
10. TechXplore articles: 13:23 GMT → 18:53 IST
11. Jerusalem Post on AI self-harm advice: 11:08 GMT → 16:38 IST
12. CSOOnline (Nvidia): 05:00 GMT → ... Wait, the Nvidia one is from 05:00 GMT? Wait, looking back:

Wait, the third article's date is Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:11:37 GMT. The summary is about Akira affiliates abusing Windows drivers. URL: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4034988/akira-affiliates-abuse-legitimate-windows-drivers-to-evade-detection-in-sonicwall-attacks.html

Wait, the date for that article is 12:11 GMT. The user might have mixed up some dates. Let me check again.

Wait, the third article's content includes a date of "Aug 5, 2025" and "Aug 6, 2025". But the actual date in the headers is "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:11:37 GMT". So the summary is about Akira affiliates abusing Windows drivers. The date in IST is 17:41.

So in order of IST time on 06 Aug:

1. TechCrunch (23:48)
2. MobiHealthNews (20:48)
3. TOI (22:22) wait, that can't be right. Wait 16:52 GMT is 22:22 IST. But 22:22 is earlier than 23:48. So TechCrunch is latest.

Wait, the TechCrunch article is 18:18 GMT → 23:48 IST. The TOI is 16:52 GMT → 22:22 IST. So the order is TechCrunch first, then TOI, then MobiHealthNews (20:48?), no, wait 15:18 GMT is 20:48 IST. So TechCrunch is 23:48, then TOI 22:22, then MobiHealthNews 20:48.

So the order for 06 Aug is:

Wait, but the TechXplore article's content is a list with multiple items, but the user provided the URL as https://techxplore.com/news/2025-08-monolayer-boosts-tin-perovskite-solar.html. The summary should be one concise sentence. So perhaps "Researchers develop AI-powered storytime tool to support children's literacy".

Similarly, the Jerusalem Post article is about AI giving self-harm advice.

Now, I need to check each summary to ensure they are concise and accurate.

For example, the first TechCrunch article: "Google takes on ChatGPT's Study Mode with new 'Guided Learning' tool in Gemini" which incorporates images and videos.

The TOI article: Microsoft creates self-defending software using AI.

The Fox article: Trump admin partners with OpenAI for federal use of ChatGPT.

The Intuit article: Accountants adopting AI, challenges emerging.

Akira article: Cybersecurity threat using Windows drivers.

SpyCloud article: Enhances AI-driven investigations.

TCS layoffs: Survey on AI workforce impact.

AI bot: Generates significant returns in trading.

TechXplore: AI tools for children, robotic sheets, ChatGPT risks.

Jerusalem Post: AI provides harmful advice to vulnerable users.

Other articles: Securityweek, Fintech futures, etc.

I need to ensure all 06 Aug articles are covered and sorted correctly. Then the 07 Aug ones.
